// In JavaScript, a promise is an object that returns a value that you hope to receive in the future, but not now.

// Because the value will be returned by the promise in the future, the promise is very well-suited for handling asynchronous operations.

// Itâ€™ll be easier to understand the concept of JavaScript promises through an analogy.

// let completed = true;

// let learnJS = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
//   if (completed) {
//     resolve("I have completed learning JS.");
//   } else {
//     reject("I haven't completed learning JS yet.");
//   }
//   return completed();
// });
// learnJS();

// Example 2
let completed = true;

let learnJS = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (completed) {
      resolve("I have completed learning JS.");
    } else {
      reject("I haven't completed learning JS yet.");
    }
  }, 3 * 1000);
});

console.log(learnJS);
